# Dockerfile Build Errors - Comprehensive Analysis and Fix

## Date: October 6, 2025
## PR: #39 - Fix Dockerfile Build Errors

---

## 🔍 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **CRITICAL: Incorrect COPY Paths**
**Issue:** Lines 20 and 30 have path mismatches
```dockerfile
# Line 20 - WRONG
COPY --link app/package.json app/yarn.lock ./app/

# Line 30 - WRONG  
COPY --link . .
```

**Root Cause:**
- The repository structure has ALL application code inside the `app/` subdirectory
- `package.json` and `yarn.lock` are at `app/package.json` and `app/yarn.lock`
- The Dockerfile tries to copy from `app/` to `/app/app/` which creates incorrect nesting
- When Docker copies `.` it includes the root `app/` directory, creating `/app/app/`

**Impact:**
- Build fails with `"/app/yarn.lock": not found`
- Files end up in wrong locations: `/app/app/app/` instead of `/app/app/`

---

### 2. **CRITICAL: WORKDIR Confusion**
**Issue:** Multiple WORKDIR changes create path confusion
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app          # Line 16
WORKDIR /app/app      # Line 24
WORKDIR /app          # Line 29
WORKDIR /app/app      # Line 33
```

**Root Cause:**
- Switching between `/app` and `/app/app` multiple times
- Unclear which directory is the actual application root
- Creates nested directory structure issues

**Impact:**
- Commands run in wrong directories
- Files copied to incorrect locations
- Build and runtime failures

---

### 3. **System Package Installation Error**
**Issue:** `runc run failed: container process is already dead`

**Root Cause:**
- Occurs during `apt-get install` in base stage
- Likely caused by:
  - Insufficient resources during build
  - Network issues during package download
  - Corrupted package cache

**Impact:**
- Build fails before reaching application code
- Inconsistent build success rate

---

### 4. **Inefficient Multi-Stage Build**
**Issue:** Single-stage build without optimization

**Problems:**
- No separation between build and runtime dependencies
- Larger final image size
- Development dependencies included in production
- No build cache optimization

---

### 5. **Permission Issues**
**Issue:** User creation and chmod after USER switch

```dockerfile
USER appuser          # Line 44
RUN chmod +x /app/docker-entrypoint.sh  # Line 47 - FAILS
```

**Root Cause:**
- Cannot run privileged commands after switching to non-root user
- chmod requires root permissions

**Impact:**
- Build fails or entrypoint is not executable

---

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Architecture Decision
**Use a proper multi-stage build with clear separation:**
1. **deps stage**: Install all dependencies
2. **builder stage**: Build the application  
3. **runner stage**: Production runtime with minimal dependencies

### Key Fixes

#### 1. **Correct Directory Structure**
```dockerfile
# Application code is in app/ subdirectory
# Set WORKDIR to /app/app from the start
WORKDIR /app/app

# Copy files directly without nesting
COPY --link app/package.json app/yarn.lock ./
```

#### 2. **Simplified WORKDIR Usage**
```dockerfile
# Set once and stay consistent
WORKDIR /app/app
# All subsequent commands run from /app/app
```

#### 3. **Robust System Package Installation**
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    --no-install-recommends \
    ca-certificates \
    openssl \
    postgresql-client \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && apt-get clean
```

**Improvements:**
- Added `--no-install-recommends` to reduce package size
- Removed unnecessary packages (fuse3, sqlite3)
- Added `apt-get clean` for better cleanup
- Better error handling

#### 4. **Multi-Stage Build Optimization**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: deps - Install dependencies only
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS deps
# ... install dependencies ...

# Stage 2: builder - Build application
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS builder
COPY --from=deps /app/app/node_modules ./node_modules
# ... build app ...

# Stage 3: runner - Production runtime
FROM node:20-bookworm-slim AS runner
COPY --from=builder /app/app/.next ./.next
# ... minimal production setup ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Smaller final image (only production dependencies)
- Better build caching
- Faster rebuilds
- Cleaner separation of concerns

#### 5. **Fixed Permission Handling**
```dockerfile
# Create user and set permissions BEFORE switching user
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash -u 1001 appuser && \
    mkdir -p /data && \
    chown -R appuser:appuser /data /app

# Make entrypoint executable while still root
RUN chmod +x /app/docker-entrypoint.sh

# Switch to non-root user LAST
USER appuser
```

## 🎯 DOCKERFILE CHANGES SUMMARY

### Before (Broken)
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
COPY --link app/package.json app/yarn.lock ./app/
WORKDIR /app/app
RUN yarn install
WORKDIR /app
COPY --link . .
WORKDIR /app/app
RUN yarn build
```
**Result:** Files in `/app/app/app/` ❌

### After (Fixed)
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app/app
COPY --link app/package.json app/yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install
COPY --link app/ ./
RUN yarn build
```
**Result:** Files in `/app/app/` ✅

## 📝 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

After deployment, verify:

1. **Build Success**
   ```bash
   # Check build logs for errors
   # Should complete without "not found" errors
   ```

2. **File Locations**
   ```bash
   # In running container:
   ls -la /app/app/package.json    # Should exist
   ls -la /app/app/.next           # Should exist
   ls -la /app/docker-entrypoint.sh # Should exist and be executable
   ```

3. **Application Startup**
   ```bash
   # Check logs for:
   # ✅ Database connection successful
   # ✅ Migrations applied
   # ✅ Server started on port 8080
   ```

4. **Runtime Verification**
   ```bash
   # Access the application
   curl http://localhost:8080
   # Should return HTML response
   ```
