## üìà Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- ‚úÖ Client-side data caching
- ‚úÖ Optimistic UI updates
- ‚úÖ Lazy loading of components
- ‚úÖ Debounced search input
- ‚úÖ Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- ‚úÖ Image optimization for photos

### Performance Metrics
- Initial page load: < 2s
- Client list rendering: < 500ms
- Form submission: < 1s
- Photo upload: < 3s (depends on file size)

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Photo Storage:** Photos are stored in the database as URLs. Consider moving to cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for production.
2. **Search:** Basic text search only. Consider implementing full-text search for better results.
3. **Pagination:** Client list shows all clients. Implement pagination for large datasets.
4. **Export:** No export functionality yet (CSV, PDF).
5. **Bulk Operations:** No bulk edit/delete functionality.

### Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 1)
- Advanced filtering (by date, status, tags)
- Client tags/categories
- Client import from CSV
- Client export to CSV/PDF
- Bulk operations
- Client merge functionality
- Advanced search with filters
- Client activity timeline
- Client loyalty program integration
